```{r cars}

df <- cars
summary(cars)

```

The average speed of cars is `r mean(df$speed)`.

```{r, data_table, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
library(stargazer)
stargazer(data = head(cars, n = 4), type = "latex", summary = FALSE, header = FALSE,
          title = "First four rows of the dataset")

```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
